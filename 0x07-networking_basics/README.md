Networking basics #0

OSI(Open System Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make the communication possible. Its organizated from the lowest level to the highest level:
 
    lowest level: Layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layer with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
    highest level: Layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for web browser. 


OSI Model Diagram:

        - Application Layer (Layer 7) - HTTP, FTP, SMTP etc.
Data    - Presentation Layer (Layer 6) - Jpeg, GIF, etc.
        - Session Layer (Layer 5) - Apple talk 


Segments        - Transport Layer (Layer 4) - TCP/UDP
Packets         - Network Layer (Layer 3) - IP, IPX, ICMP
Frame           - Data Link (Layer 2) - PPT, Ethernet
Bits            - Physical (Layer 1) - Ethernet, USB

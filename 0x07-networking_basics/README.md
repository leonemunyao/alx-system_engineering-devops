Networking basics #0

OSI(Open System Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make the communication possible. Its organizated from the lowest level to the highest level:
 
    lowest level: Layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layer with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
    highest level: Layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for web browser. 


OSI Model Diagram:

        - Application Layer (Layer 7) - HTTP, FTP, SMTP etc.
Data    - Presentation Layer (Layer 6) - Jpeg, GIF, etc.
        - Session Layer (Layer 5) - Apple talk 


Segments        - Transport Layer (Layer 4) - TCP/UDP
Packets         - Network Layer (Layer 3) - IP, IPX, ICMP
Frame           - Data Link (Layer 2) - PPT, Ethernet
Bits            - Physical (Layer 1) - Ethernet, USB



TYPES OF NETWORK

Types of Network include LAN, WAN, and other kinds of local area networks. The difference between LAN and WAN can be seen in different ways. Home Networking include, The wireless Connection, Routers & Firewall, Network Hubs, ISP, Broadband, Ethernet, Installing and Upgrading, WiFi and Wireless. 

Types of Area Networks are: LAN(Local Area Network), WAN(Wide Area Network), WLAN(Wireless Local Area Network), MAN(Metropolitan Area Network), SAN(Storage Area Network), CAN(Campus Area Network), PAN(Personal Area Network).

LAN and WAN are the two primary and best known categories of area networks

LAN(Local Area Network)
Connects devices over a relatively short distance

WAN(Wide Area  Network)
Connects devices across large distances using multiple technologies. Residents basically employ LAN and connect to the internet WAN through an Internet Service Provider(ISP) using a broadband modem. The ISP provides a WAN IP address (also called private IP address). All computers in a home LAN can communicate directly with each other but must go through a central network gateway, typiically a broadband router, to reach the ISP and beyond.

LAN connect local devices together, WAN connects LANs together and WAN's are operating over the Internet.
